## Real-Time WiFi CSI Intrusion Detection using ESP32 and Deep Learning

CSI Sentinel is a real-time device-free intrusion detection system that uses WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) captured from an ESP32-E in passive sensing mode. The project combines wireless sensing, signal processing, and deep learning to detect human presence and motion without requiring cameras, wearable devices, or dedicated sensors.

The ESP32 continuously captures CSI packets from ambient WiFi traffic and streams them to a GPU-enabled edge machine for real-time parsing, feature extraction, visualization, and inference. A CNN + LSTM deep learning pipeline processes CSI amplitude and phase information to classify environmental activity as either normal or intrusion.
